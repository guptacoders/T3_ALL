                <h4>PM: Youth should lead nation in politics</h4>
                <p>
                  Gandhinagar: Speaking via teleconferencing at an event of the
                  Ramakrishna Math in Ahmedabad on Monday, Prime Minister
                  Narendra Modi said that India is the youngest nation in the
                  world. Like the youth of India who have taken the lead in
                  fields like technology, there is a need for them to lead the
                  country in politics as well. At the event, chief minister
                  Bhupendra Patel inaugurated a cafeteria, prayer hall and
                  housing facilities of the Ramkrishna Math. The PM announced
                  that on Jan 12 next year, celebrated as Youth Day, the Union
                  govt will organise the ‘Young Leaders Dialogue' in Delhi. He
                  added that 2,000 selected youth will be invited, while crores
                  from across the country will join the event online. He added
                  that the resolution of a developed India from the perspective
                  of the youth will be discussed, and a roadmap to connect the
                  youth with politics will be prepared.

                  rhetoric', says saffron party
                </h4>
                <p>
                  NEW DELHI: Ahead of the Delhi Assembly polls, the AAP on
                  Sunday accused the BJP of settling Rohingya refugees in the
                  city while publicly vilifying them. Reacting to the
                  allegation, the BJP said the real issue is not the settlement
                  of legal refugees but the presence of millions of
                  illegally-residing Rohingya Muslims and Bangladeshis not only
                  in Delhi but also in other states and accused the Aam Aadmi
                  Party (AAP) of resorting to "baseless rhetoric". In a
                  statement, senior AAP leaders, including Chief Minister
                  Atishi, Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh and former deputy chief
                  minister Manish Sisodia, pointed to a 2022 post on X by Union
                  minister Hardeep Singh Puri as evidence of the Bharatiya
                  Janata Party's (BJP) involvement in housing Rohingya Muslims
                  in EWS (Economically Weaker Section) flats in Delhi's
                  Bakkarwala area.
