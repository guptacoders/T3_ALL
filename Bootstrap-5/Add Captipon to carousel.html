            <p>A food court is a spacious area in shopping malls, airports, or large entertainment complexes where a variety of food vendors and eateries are clustered together. It offers a wide range of dining options, from fast food and snacks to more elaborate meals. Food courts provide a convenient and efficient way for customers to choose from a diverse selection of cuisines in one location. Each stall or counter in the food court typically specializes in a different type of food, such as burgers, pizza, Asian cuisine, or salads, allowing visitors to enjoy a variety of flavors in a casual setting. Food courts are popular for their affordability, fast service, and social atmosphere, making them ideal for both quick bites and leisurely meals with friends or family.</p>
